# Apps on the App Store

Learn to Drive A-Z is my app on the App Store, which helps people prepare to take the Driver’s Knowledge Exam for getting a Virginian Driver’s License. It was originally hosted under my mom’s name, but now I transferred it to my account as I’m over 18.

I first started to work on this app during the winter break of 2016, when I started to prepare for the exam. I find it inconvenient to carry around the driver’s manual, and there’s no easy way to view all the practice quiz problems. Since I started to learn the Swift Programming Language in 2015 on my own, I haven’t been able to put my newfound skills into practice, so I saw this as a perfect chance to make my first app. And by the time our school started, I have completed the first working version, anxiously reviewing in the DMV’s waiting area with my app, and passed the test with flying colors. Hooray!

Excited, I shared my app with my classmates who are also preparing for the exam; they too used my app to study for their exams. When my family friends moved to Virginia, they also tried it out to help with their preparations. Due to the app transfer, I could no longer see how many people have benefited from my weekend project, but once there were at least 5000 users, and I’m proud of myself for making this achievement.

Now many years have passed, I continue to make incremental changes to the app, utilizing the newly released technologies and improve existing experiences. Recently I did a more comprehensive accessibility check to make sure everyone can have equal access to the information presented in the app, improved the dark mode support, and more. I’m currently working on adding home screen widgets to show “question of the day,” and hopefully it will be out by WWDC21, so I could add even more new features.
