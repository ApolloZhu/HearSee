 # Hear See

 Well, certainly having someone speak out when we are close to some obstacles are helpful, but what if, we can know exactly where we could potential hit, without seeing it?

 Since we already have the depth data of the surroundings, we could:

 1. locate the point that's closet us, and keep track of it;
 2. play, with spatial audio, a sound track from that point

 With these steps, you'll be able to hear where the nearest obstacle is, and thus navigate the space without bumping into anything.

//: - Experiment: That was fun, but you could try additional customizations for the nearest location marker.

/*: - Example:
 You could use [Reality Composer](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/) to design a different marker shape, or just generate a simple spherical one using the code below (to replace `model`):

 ```swift
 let mesh = MeshResource.generateSphere(radius: 0.05)
 let material = SimpleMaterial(color: #colorLiteral(red: 0.4, green: 0.8, blue: 1, alpha: 1), isMetallic: false)
 let model = ModelEntity(mesh: mesh, materials: [material])
 ```
