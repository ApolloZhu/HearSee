#warning("\n👋 Hi, this is the technical discussion of the following stack trace, explaining why this interruption is (most likely) not \"Error Compiling Source\" or some bug I wrote.\n\n🕵️ If you take a look at the source code of this playground, you'll notice that there are 0 (ZERO) lines of Metal code, and main thread checker passes for the LiveViewTestApp. However, the stack trace complained about some Metal thread 🤯, and there is no red dot appears taking us to the line of error, making it most likely some Swift Playgrounds specific issue for Metal/RealityKit. Or it could be something more obscure that couldn't be figure out without checking the stack trace/source code of everything involved, which I don't have access to 🙃.\n\n\n")
